_We used `fig` to build [canopy.banyan.sh](https://canopy.banyan.sh), our live frontend for the Canopy social network. Check it out!_

## Overview

Fig is React hooks for [xmtp](https://xmtp.org), [brpc](../brpc/), [banyan](../../apps/banyan/), and [Canopy](../../apps/canopy/) With `fig` you can comopse applications using open data protocols.

## Features

`fig` is hooks for...

__XMTP__

The [xmtp-js](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js) SDK allows you to send, receive, and subscribe to XMTP conversations. `fig` provides a set of ergonomic hooks for working directly with `xmtp-js`.

__brpc__

`fig` provides hooks to access any live `brpc` backend but works best when paired with a published typesafe API. Learn more about how to build and publish `brpc` APIs [here](../brpc/).

__Banyan__

[Banyan](../../apps/banyan/) is a key-value server for XMTP. You can use `Banyan` to build open data protocols. `fig` provides hooks for Banyan's entire API.

__Canopy__

[Canopy](../../apps/canopy/) is a completely open social network powered by Banyan and XMTP. With `fig` you can add social networking features to your app with just a few lines of code.

We used `fig` to build [canopy.banyan.sh](https://canopy.banyan.sh), our live frontend for Canopy!
