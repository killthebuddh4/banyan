# Overview

Minnow is the minimal viable decentralized social network.

# Features

Minnow is a (very) small bundle of features, each of which is itself a tiny standalone [canopy](../canopy/) protocol. Right now, a "canopy protocol" is just a set of naming conventions applied to a tuple store.

# Goals and Non-Goals

The primary purpose behind Minnow is to showcase the power of the ideas behind [Canopy](../canopy/) (and therefore [xmtp](https://xmtp.org)). We want to explore just how far we can get when we add a message broker to public keys. When we encounter tradeoffs between UX and these technical goals, we will sacrifice UX _unless there exists a cogent, written, and viable-with-current-technology plan to repay the "technical debt"_.
